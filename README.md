# Canvas

[Canvas](https://github.com/instructure/canvas-lms) on Github

## Install Canvas with Chef and Vagrant

### Install Vagrant
Vagrant depends on VirtualBox. You can download it from [here](http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).  
To install Vagrant download your os specific package from [Vagrant](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/).
Or as alternative (though the previous method is preferred).

    gem install vagrant (or use the supplied .rvmrc file when using RVM)

### Checkout and start VM

    git clone https://github.com/zilverline/chef-canvas.git
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    vagrant up

The directory `shared` is mapped to the shared folder in the vagrant home dir.
It contains a file `runlist.json` which can be used when Vagrant has started the vm.

    vagrant ssh
    sudo chef-solo -j shared/runlist.json

After the VM is running and all the Chef Cookbooks ran you could suspend your vm.

    vagrant suspend

And to start the vm again

    vagrant resume

### Start canvas
After the vm has started and the cookbooks ran you should be able to start canvas `cd /opt/canvas;RAILS_ENV=test scripts/server` and access it on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Improvements/todo

* Add /var/lib/ruby/1.8/gems... to PATH variable
* Connect to SURFconext
* Use SSL certificate
* Use [Databse cookbook](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/database) for databse
* Install on real vm
* Pin version of ruby (1.8.7)
* Whole word grep in user and db exists functions
* Security.yml encryption_key is overwritten (only test??), do we need to create security.yml?
* Config files needed?
    * delayed-jobs
    * file-store
    * ext_migration
* Can execute resource be used instead of bash in db.rb
* Do we really need the coffeescript recipe?
* Add more CPUs to Vagrant
* Beat Sander with fu√üball
